    THIS NAPP IS STILL EXPERIMENTAL AND IT'S EVENTS, METHODS AND STRUCTURES MAY
    CHANGE A LOT ON THE NEXT FEW DAYS/WEEKS, USE IT AT YOUR OWN DISCERNEMENT

This NApp is responsible for tracking the network topology and supplying
network topology information to any NApp that requires it.

This NApp intends to be protocol agnostic. Therefore, if you want to provide
network topology data from any network protocol, check the listened events
section and generate them from your NApp.

##########
Installing
##########

All of the Kytos Network Applications are located in the NApps online
repository. To install this NApp, run:

.. code:: shell

   $ kytos napps install kytos/topology

############
Requirements
############

- kytos/of_core
- kytos/of_lldp
- kytos/storehouse

###########
Configuring
###########

You have few options to configure the behaviour of this NApp in the
`settings.py` file. Please take a look in this file.

You can customize circuits in the topology using a JSON configuration file. See
`etc/circuits.json.sample` for an example.

Circuits can have a name, a list of hops and as many numeric custom properties
as the user wants.

We are working to deliver methods and resources to extend the custom properties
in the future.
